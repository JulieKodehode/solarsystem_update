# Solar System

In this project I will take a former project and make a few changes to upgrade this project to display it on my portfolio. The main ones is transferring it into React and making the side responsive for mobile.

I later want to add more to this project to display more of my own talents and interests:

- For instance making a red tread trough the pages so it will be more connected.
- Less informative and more of an space advertisement.
- More to come.

## Description:

This fall we got at group project from KodeHode to make a website with the topic being the solar system. Our group decided to make it an informative page, and decided on Mars and Venus as our two main planet sides to feature. Mainly focusing on color, font and placing of content to display our interest in web design. Content text found on wikipedia.
